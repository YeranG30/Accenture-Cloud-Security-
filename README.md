# Accenture Cloud Security Externship  
**March 2025 – May 2025**  
Remote (Virtual Experience) – Sponsored by Accenture

---

## Overview  
This externship was part of Accenture’s Cloud Security Virtual Experience Program, simulating real-world security consulting for a healthcare‑tech client (Digital Health). Over five tasks, I focused on cloud architecture, IAM scalability, secure SDLC, testing, and delivery best practices, collaborating with simulated infrastructure, development, and security teams.

---

## Task 1: Cloud Architecture Review  
**Objective:** Determine optimal AWS infrastructure strategy balancing cost, scalability, and compliance.

**Deliverables:**
- Evaluated IaaS vs. PaaS options based on client technical and compliance needs.
- Applied the AWS Well‑Architected Framework to reinforce design principles.
- Proposed migration plans to enhance operational resilience and reduce vendor lock‑in.

---

## Task 2: IAM Design & Security Maturity Assessment  
**Objective:** Elevate IAM governance to NIST CSF Tier 2 (Risk‑Informed) standard.

**Deliverables:**
- Assessed IAM policies and roles across business units; highlighted privilege misalignments.
- Recommended group‑based RBAC with attribute‑based access logic for enterprise scale.
- Proposed AWS Organizations SCPs and IAM Identity Center for centralized permission enforcement.
- Created IAM audit and response playbooks using CloudTrail and Access Analyzer.

---

## Task 3: Secure SDLC Implementation  
**Objective:** Integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline using code-based practices.

**Deliverables:**
- Performed SAST to uncover vulnerabilities like path traversal and IDOR.
- Built security-as-code GitHub Actions workflows using Snyk and policy gates.
- Introduced exemption workflows and staged rollouts to protect developer agility.
- Documented SSDLC process tailored to Agile team environments.

---

## Task 4: Testing & Validation  
**Objective:** Ensure security controls function as intended through structured testing.

**Deliverables:**
- Executed unit tests and created UAT scenarios aligned to security requirements.
- Verified outcomes against compliance and threat models.

---

## Task 5: Agile Methodology Alignment  
**Objective:** Compare delivery methodologies and recommend security‑aligned approaches.

**Deliverables:**
- Evaluated Waterfall vs. Agile in context of security implementations.
- Suggested a phased Agile rollout for security controls across teams.

---

## Key Outcomes  
- Designed a secure and scalable AWS architecture guided by the Well‑Architected Framework.  
- Upgraded IAM governance from siloed access to centralized, risk-informed RBAC.  
- Built and documented an SSDLC pipeline with embedded CI/CD security policies.  
- Translated security testing into enterprise deliverables aligned with compliance and threat models.

---

## Tools & Frameworks  
**Cloud / IAM:** AWS IAM, Organizations, SCPs, GuardDuty, CloudTrail  
**Security Tools:** Terraform, GitHub Actions, Open Policy Agent (OPA), Snyk  
**Frameworks:** AWS Well‑Architected, NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK Cloud

## Final Note  
This externship mirrors Accenture client engagements in cloud security transformation. The experience provided hands-on work designing IAM governance, secure deployment pipelines, incident-readiness tools, and scalable DevSecOps frameworks—skills directly applicable to enterprise-grade roles.
